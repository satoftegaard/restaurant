      <p>Home made ice cream, dessert waffles, milkshakes and sundaes! URBAN Creamery is the dessert arm of the URBAN family in downtown St. Petersburg, Florida. We’ve made it our focus to make our own ice cream on site and waffles from scratch to construct balanced and creative dessert combinations. We love ice cream! Savory waffles, sweet ice cream, creamy milkshakes… of course we want to make this stuff!</p>
